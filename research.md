    abstract: Institutional investors increasingly hold firms in both the industrial and financial sectors. These cross-industry holdings link firms to “outside” banks that they have not borrowed from, creating a network between the two sectors. We show that such networks reduce firms’ loan spreads. This effect is more prominent when cross-holders are actively involved in borrowers’ routine operations and when they have stronger incentives to advocate for borrowers in the loan process. Furthermore, outside banks begin to lend more to firms once the two parties become linked. This network is “behind-the-scenes” because it does not arise from prior interactions between firms and banks, but is instead built through institutions’ cross-holdings.

    abstract: We assess how labor mobility affects intangible investment in a dynamic agency model featuring both knowledge appropriation and moral hazard. We argue that restricting worker mobility, while reducing employees' appropriation of firm intangible capital, can hurt their incentives to exert effort. Our calibration to U.S. data targets responses of employee turnover and firms' intangible investment to variations in workers' outside option values, identified through exogenous shocks to non-compete enforcement. The model simulation implies that knowledge spillovers mitigate the costs of incentive provision when agency frictions are severe, and the optimal labor mobility regulation should balance this benefit against turnover risk. Finally, we highlight the use of deferred compensation bonuses in the optimal contract as a retention mechanism, even among under-performing firms.

    abstract: We utilize granular data from the life sciences sector to study how VC activism influences strategic experimentation decisions. Active involvement by smaller, more focused VCs drives early pipeline prioritization, advancing a few projects while holding back most of the R&D portfolio. While this approach can create "blockbuster" IPOs with mature lead pipelines, it also reduces overall exit likelihood by sacrificing the benefits of a diversified pipeline. Startups backed by concentrated VCs progress more slowly in clinical trials on average and are more likely to discontinue projects due to prioritization rather than financial or quality concerns. Additionally, VCs may prioritize suboptimal projects due to investment horizons or concerns about portfolio cannibalization. Overall, this prioritization strategy increases failure risk particularly for high-risk, long-horizon technologies. To address endogeneity, we exploit limited partners’ adoption of ESG objectives as instruments for shifts in VCs’ portfolio focus.

    abstract: We document that interactions with manipulated decision support systems can distort the development of human capital using the context of opioid prescription. Physicians in our sample adopted electronic health record software from a list of federally certified companies in 2011. Between 2016 and spring 2019, one company secretly embedded a biased decision support system function to promote extended-release opioid sales. Affected physicians not only increased opioid claims relative to the control group during the treatment window but also maintained a higher propensity for prescriptions even after the removal of the biased function. This long-term distortion of human capital relies on the unconsciousness of algorithmic biases and does not occur following other explicit promotions, such as pharmaceutical detailing payments. Using machine-learning algorithms, we quantify that human capital distortion explains 54% of the treatment effects in a physician decision model with dynamic learning. Experience with opioids, along with caution regarding elder patients, mitigates the distortion.

    abstract: We examine how public health crises undermine bank deposit funding and constrain lending activities. Using the opioid epidemic as our empirical setting, we document a negative link between local opioid supply and deposit growth at both the county and bank levels. Facing deposit drains, banks systematically reduce lending activities, including mortgage origination and approval, even in distant regions connected to the epidemic areas through banking networks. These reductions are more pronounced for retained loans and concentrate in smaller banks facing greater financial frictions and lacking geographic diversification. Our findings highlight the challenges to bank operations arising from population health conditions.
